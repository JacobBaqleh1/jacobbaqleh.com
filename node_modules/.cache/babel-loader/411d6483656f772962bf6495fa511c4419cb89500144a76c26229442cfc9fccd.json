I have worked in sales for the past 4 years and now I am making the switch to web development. Over the past 2 years, I have been focusing on frontend development and building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I have expanded my knowledge to full-stack development and I am excited to learn more about back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases. I have a passion for creating user-friendly, responsive websites that enhance the user experience. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. One thing that I love about the developer community is the opportunity to connect with others who share my passion for technology and to learn from their experiences.
